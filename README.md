## About
This is an ongoing project that includes assessments and assignments by **ALX** coding Bootcamp facilitated by **Holberton** coding school.

## Intro
> Do hard things. "Fred Swaniker"

> From day one in this coding program Fred Swaniker always said that to solve the world's biggest problems you have to do hard things.
> To my future employers, this Repo is one of many programs-assignments through the ALX Africa Software Engineering program.
> To my dear peers and ALX cohort colleagues, I hope you find this repo helpful in clarifying a few things. Remember ~plagiarism~ ❌ Creativity ✅
